**Cyclistic Case Study – Google Data Analytics Capstone**

Welcome to my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate. In this case study, I step into the role of a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The goal is to analyze user behavior and provide actionable insights.

📌 **Project Overview**

Cyclistic’s marketing team wants to understand how different types of riders use the service. By analyzing historical trip data, I uncover patterns and trends that inform a strategic marketing plan aimed at increasing membership.

🎯 **Objectives**

- Explore how customers and subscribers differ in their riding habits
- Identify key factors influencing ride duration, frequency, and timing
- Visualize trends to support data-driven decision-making
- Recommend strategies to convert casual riders into loyal members

🛠 **Tools & Technologies**

| Tool | Purpose |
|--------------|---------------------------------|
| **R** | Data cleaning, transformation |
| **tidyverse** | Data manipulation and wrangling |
| **ggplot2** | Static visualizations |
| **plotly** | Interactive charts |
| **R Markdown** | Documentation and reporting |

📊 **Key Insights**

- Casual riders tend to ride more on weekends and during warmer months
- Annual members show consistent usage throughout the week
- Ride length is significantly longer for casual riders
- Gender and birth year data provide additional segmentation opportunities

📌 **Business Recommendations**

Based on the analysis, I propose:

- Incentives for longer-term membership sign-ups
- Personalized campaigns using demographic insights
