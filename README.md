Welcome to my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate. In this case study, I step into the role of a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The goal is to analyze user behavior and provide actionable insights.

### 📌 Project Overview  
Cyclistic’s marketing team wants to understand how different types of riders use the service. By analyzing historical trip data, I uncover patterns and trends that inform a strategic marketing plan aimed at increasing membership.

### 🎯 Objectives  
- Explore how customers and subscribers differ in their riding habits
- Identify key factors influencing ride duration, frequency, and timing
- Visualize trends to support data-driven decision-making
- Recommend strategies to convert casual riders into loyal members

### 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
| Tool | Purpose |
|--------------|---------------------------------|
| **R** | Data cleaning, transformation |
| **tidyverse** | Data manipulation and wrangling |
| **ggplot2** | Static visualizations |
| **plotly** | Interactive charts |
| **R Markdown** | Documentation and reporting |
| **Power BI**   | Interactive dashboard |

### 🔑 Key Insights  
- Subscibers show consistent usage throughout the week
- Ride length is significantly longer for customers
- Gender and birth year data provide additional segmentation opportunities
  
### 📌 Business Recommendations  
Based on the analysis, I propose:

- Incentives for longer-term membership sign-ups
- Personalized campaigns using demographic insights
