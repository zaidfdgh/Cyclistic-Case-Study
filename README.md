# Cyclistic-Case-Study
This project is the final capstone for the Google Data Analytics Certificate, where I take on the role of a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The goal is to uncover how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
